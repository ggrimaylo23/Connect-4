# Connect-4
 A modified version of Connect 4 in Python. An agent is made using different search algorithms (minimax, depth limited minimax, alpha-beta pruning minimax), and this agent can play against humans or other automated agents. The game will continue until the board is full (even if a player achieves 4 in a row) and scores for each player will be calculated to determine who wins.
